        Hi, my name is Dorvil Gabriel a full stack blockchain developer. Prior to this endeavor I spent about 5 years developing software for nuclear submarines. I always spend my free time learning random new things that piqued my interest. One day, like many of us in the Web3 industry, I was captured and fell down the perpetual crypto/blockchain rabbit hole. After countless books and YouTube videos, I realized I needed to make a full 180 in my career. Realizing this technology can truly change the world for the better and naturally I created an NFT to start my journey off as a blockchain developer.
